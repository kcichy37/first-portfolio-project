# Letchworth Sports Centre 
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of the sports centre would be to provide quality sport facilities that are functional through-out the whole year for publics use. The website is made to help the public find information regarding this Sport Centre such as about us, where it is, how we can be contacted e.g., email and phone number. The website will also provide information regarding what facilities and what sports we provide and additional information such as costs. Website will also enable the customer to book a sport session of their choice through the booking page.

The website needs to be easy to navigate so that any customer will be able to understand it and book through it, as the target audience is the general public ranging from young kids accompanied by adults to older public.
