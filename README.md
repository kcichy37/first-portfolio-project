# Letchworth Sports Centre 
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of the sports centre would be to provide quality sport facilities that are functional through-out the whole year for publics use. The website is made to help the public find information regarding this Sport Centre such as about us, where it is, how we can be contacted e.g., email and phone number. The website will also provide information regarding what facilities and what sports we provide and additional information such as costs. Website will also enable the customer to book a sport session of their choice through the booking page.

The website needs to be easy to navigate so that any customer will be able to understand it and book through it, as the target audience is the general public ranging from young kids accompanied by adults to older public.

#### Contact Details and Opening times
- The first visible information on the Contact Us page is the contact details which include the phone number and email, as well as, allows user to fill out a form that will send their query straight to the sports centres email. This is really convinient for the user as they don't have to copy the e-mail and go into their e-mail, instead they can just send their query straight away by filling out the form.
- If the form is to be used and filled out, it is accompanied by a Submit button. However, the form will only submit once the user types in the required information.After pressing the submit button the user will be directed to a thank you page.
- Next information available is the opening hours.

## Future Features
- I would like to add to the webpage a log in for accounts so that reoccurring customers are able to just log in with all their detail saved, including payment information, enabling to book by just choosing what they want without filling other information. 
- Membership deals, for customers that are reoccuring users of our facilities. For a monthly fee they will be able to use certain facilities under the Terms & Conditions that membership would have. E.g, for £30 a month you can use the Table tennis facility you have 8 hours to use.

## Wireframes/Planning
I have used Wireframes to construct a very rough idea of the website. While building the website I have changed a lot compared to the initial ideas. 

- [Home page idea](./assets/readme-images/home-idea.png). While developing the website, I decided that the home page will have 3 sections "About us", "What we offer" and "opening time" instead of "About us" "Opening times" and a "Google maps `iframes`". With this decision also came a completley different layout where each section has it's own area and different decorative forms, one a background picture and the other a video. I also moved the `iframes` to contact page. 

- [Facilities page idea](./assets/readme-images/facilities-idea.png) The first idea for the Facilities page was that it will have 6 boxes describing each sports and one book button at the bottom. I ended up minimising the sport boxes to 4 with 5 sports as 1 sport box includes two sports. Also changed the layout as the sport boxes are below each other, where in the initial idea it was opposite each other and each box has it's own booking button

- [Contact Us page idea](./assets/readme-images/contact-us-idea.png) The Contact us page is where I stuck to the idea the most just changed the layout as I included the contact details, opening hours and address together rather than seperate like on the idea.
